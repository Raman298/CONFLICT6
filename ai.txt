Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and make decisions. AI systems are capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, speech recognition, and decision-making. They range from narrow AI, which specializes in specific tasks, to general AI, which aspires to perform a wide range of human-like activities. AI is transforming industries like healthcare, education, and transportation, offering innovative solutions and enhancing efficiency. It's a technology that continues to evolve, shaping the future in fascinating ways.
